	<h1> Google Sheets "backend" </h1>
	<p class="text">This website is supported by a Google spreadsheet, because this project actually started out by running on Google Sheets. With the help of APIs, I can port this to the website with little programming knowledge. I still haven't bothered on running stuff on server-side or setting up online SQL databases, but here it is, a website for you to navigate through the list without scrolling through thousands of demons.

	<h2> Using the Google Spreadsheets website </h2>
	<p class="text"> Most of the information about how the spreadsheet works can be found over at the Useful Information sheet there. There are also functions specifically for spreadsheets that you can use to help getting the demon you want in the list: </p>
	<p class="text"> - filter function for searching for demons in a certain tier or having a certain official difficulty etc. <br>
	- search function for finding demon with a specific name </p>
