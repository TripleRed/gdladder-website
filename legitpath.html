			Entering a code at the start of MasterGame to start at late game IS a legitimate path because the said path covers the whole level. <br><br>

			The first coin for Clubstep IS a legitimate path because you can sight-read and tell that you can use the yellow orb to reach the coin. <br><br>

			The second coin for X IS a legitimate path because although quite hard to do so, it is possible to sightread and tell that you can obtain the coin through entering in opposite gravity.

			The first coin at Spark by PotatoBaby IS NOT a legitimate path because the coin is hidden, and the question mark can really mean anything. <br><br>

			A bug at a level IS NOT a legitimate path because you probably need to know that level is buggy in order to use the said loophole to skip sections. Exception: the level is poorly designed and it is obvious that you can abuse bugs. <br><br>

			A very obscure path for a 1.0 level IS NOT a legitimate path. I know 1.0 levels often have split paths, but we do not want players to search for that one path just to finish the level in an easier way. <br><br>
