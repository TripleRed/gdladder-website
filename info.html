	<h1> It's just to fill in what is not enough </h1>

	<p class="text">Launched in August 2020, this project is a list of EVERY demon rated, with a little tier put beside it. It originated from the discussion that the demon difficulties in-game is not enough. The division of difficulties for demons is always a subject to discuss, but there isn't a definitive list for this. Well, until now!</p>

	<p class="text">This project is created with the following two problems in mind:<br>
	1) Although the official difficulty for demons in-game is good, it is too broad to serve as a reference. Difficulty can vary greatly inside the same demon category.<br>
	2) There is not a default demon difficulty, and all freshly rated demons are deemed Hard Demons by default, making the system even more confusing.</p>

	<h2> The mechanism </h2>

	<p class="text"> With the official system in mind, each demon difficulty is split into 5 tiers. Tiers are then named from Tier 1 to Tier 25, with Tier 25 being the hardest. The illustration below shows how it works.</p>

	<div><i>what is supposed to be a picture about tiers</i></div>

	<p class="text"> Tiers are determined by user ratings. This means the list is community-driven, one thing that is loved by the owner. User ratings are collected and averaged out to obtain the final tier of a level. The system has been running well since launch, and we have collected over 1000 ratings for 700 demons, covering over 20% of the demons in the game.</p>

	<h2> Voting </h2>

	<p class="text"> As this is run on community ratings, there is a voting system for the project. Users can vote by the following ways.</p>

	<p class="text">
	- Fill in the <a href="https://forms.gle/GXbMVjqpfiHNPPXH9" target="_blank">Response Form</a> or <a href="https://forms.gle/cgQuyhDZ6YMivLXW6" target="_blank">a Bulk Response Form</a> if you have multiple demon ratings to submit at once. <br>
	- Use the custom command over at the <a href="https://discord.gg/TWhxaeM" target="_blank">Discord server</a>. <br>
	- Leave a comment over at the <a href="sheets.html">Google Spreadsheet</a> website. Note that you will need to go to the spreadsheet and reveal your Google account to do this. <br>
	- [Upcoming] Go to the Submit Ratings page of this website.
	</p>

	<h2> Rating guidelines </h2>

	<p class="text">Here are some guidelines that you should consider while voting for the tier of demons:</p>

	<p class="text">
	1) Your rating should be based on the difficulty of the whole level, which means: <br>
	- You should not rate based on the difficulty of the hardest section. <br>
	- You should not rate based on only one criteria, e.g. timing, spamming, etc. <br>
	<br>
	2) For levels that contains multiple paths or has bonus objectives, rate according to the easiest path that is not hidden.
