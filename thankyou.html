      <p style="text-align:center; font-size:32px; margin:30px 10%;">I would like to thank the following people who supported me while I run this project:</p>
      <h3> [ - ], Bagley, Dragon, DubstepJoltik, Fœ̄zi (Fezzie), SpaceZ, Srivats, Swifter, thanosisugly, therealpigchefer </h3>
      <p class="text20">Thank you for giving me support and suggestions for reference demons over at Geometry Dash Forums. I wouldn't even be able to start running this without you guys. [ - ] even generated the first form of the list for me with his power to code, which saved me from entering demons manually.</p>
      <h3> WhiteEmerald </h3>
      <p class="text20">Thank you for helping me run the project, including add many ratings into the list, being a cool moderator at the server, and telling me about different news over at rating of new demons, integrating the notification Webhook at Discord, and so much more that I simply cannot list them all.</p>
      <h3> redracer </h3>
      <p class="text20">Thank you for rating so many demons in the list so that it don't look shabby as hell. The thing I am afraid of is that nobody would add ratings into the list, but turns out many avid people are willing to share their thoughts on difficulty of demons, including you.</p>
      <h3> MonsterGamer </h3>
      <p class="text20">Thank you for giving me both technical and mental support for me to finally port the list from Google Spreadsheets into a website so that I can do lots of different shenanigans. I am still learning HTML.</p>
      <h3> Others </h3>
      <p class="text20mid">I would also like to thank: </p>
