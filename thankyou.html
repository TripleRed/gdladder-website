    <p>
      I would like to thank the following people who supported me while I run this project: <br>
      <h3> [ - ], Bagley, Dragon, DubstepJoltik, Fœ̄zi (Fezzie), SpaceZ, Srivats, Swifter, thanosisugly, therealpigchefer </h3>
      Thank you for giving me support and suggestions for reference demons over at GDForums. I wouldn't even be able to start running this without you guys. [ - ] even generated the first form of the list for me with his power to code, which saved me from entering demons manually.
      <h3> WhiteEmerald </h3>
      Thank you for helping me run the project, including add many ratings into the list, being a cool moderator at the server, and telling me about different news over at rating of new demons, integrating the notification Webhook at Discord, and so much more that I simply cannot list the all.
      <h3> redracer </h3>
      Thank you for rating so many demons in the list so that it don't look shabby as hell. The thing I am afraid of is that nobody would add ratings into the list, but turns out many avid people are willing to share their thoughts on difficulty of demons, including you.
      <h3> MonsterGamer </h3>
      Thank you for giving me both technical and mental support for me to finally port the list from Google Spreadsheets into a website so that I can do lots of different shenanigans. I am still learning HTML.
      <h3> Others </h3>
      I would also like to thank: <br>
      - u/GD_mrperson: for suggesting reference demons <br>
      - GD Colon, for creating the GD Browser API so that I can scrap information at will <br>
      - Abrubi, Andorra, atavoidturk, BanidunoGD, Cheetahx, davisantus, Electroanimator, -Fer27-, funkirbo, Gregorad, Henry03, H moment, kwdash, Landyn789, lawberry1212, mds62, namolbbaemi, OdieTheGreat, RandomGuy2108, smoke40, technobuild, twist, u/GD_mrperson, v0id96, Vuraxis: who participated in rating demons early on which helps slowly building up the foundation of this project <br> <br>
      <!-- toolong.jpg-->
      - and you, for checking this project out, and supporting me    
    </p>

      I cannot imagine what the project would be without all of you guys' effort. Thank you.<br><br>
