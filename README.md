# Hi for those who are reading this in GitHub!
This is the basic structure of the GD Ladder website which is currently hosted on replit.com.
Feel free to look around.

Ask RFMX#4373 on Discord before using any of the written code.

## To-do list
- **Figure out why sending a HTTP request to the Discord webhook returns a CORSMissingAllowOrigin error (403)**
- Program a new tab to give the player a random demon of desired tier.
- Figure out how to get subratings for spamming, timing, precision, each gamemode, etc, into the list.
- Attempt to port Python code back to JavaScript and see if it speed things up.
- *If the above does not work,* dive into HTML5 to see if there are shenanigans that allows me to run stuff interactively.
- Figure out how to OAuth the crap out of Google spreadsheets to write stuff into the list.
- *If that does not help,* look into SQL and port the entire speradsheet to there, and make life much worse for me and list helpers. (it doesn't)
- Attempt to automate entering ratings after sorting this out.
- Style the website so that it looks better instead of being just white.
- ~~Make the website mobile-friendly~~
