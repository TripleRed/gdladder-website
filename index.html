	<p class="text">The addition of demon difficulties in 2.1 is great. However, that isn't enough. With highly varying skill levels, this isn't of very high value as a reference. Compare ICDX to Bloodlust, Decode to Impact X, Windy Landscape to Nine Circles... argh! 5 demon difficulties is just not enough.</p>
	<p class="text20"><strong style="font-size: 24px;">Enter the Geometry Dash Demon Ladder!</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project divides all demons into 25 tiers, based on difficulty. Here, community votes are gathered to determine tiers of levels, and the results are published right here for everyone to search for their perfect demon to beat and compare demons to one another.</p>
